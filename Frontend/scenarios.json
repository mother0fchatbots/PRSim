The damage is not yet irreparable.</p><p>* **Financial Loss:**  Immediate financial loss is likely due to paused brand partnerships. However, long-term losses depend on the effectiveness of the crisis response.</p><p>* **Legal Consequences:**  Legal action is unlikely unless Ava is demonstrably defrauding brands through false advertising, which isn't explicitly implied here.</p><p>* **Public Trust:**  Public trust in Ava is significantly eroded, but not completely destroyed.  A well-managed response could still salvage some of her reputation.  The incident serves as a cautionary tale within the influencer industry but hasn't caused widespread panic about influencer authenticity as a whole.</p>"
